# Donald Doricent – QA-Tested Developer Portfolio 🚀

This is my personal portfolio site, built from scratch and tested like a real product. It showcases my projects, background, and QA capabilities — because I believe a site should *work* as cleanly as it looks.

## ✅ QA Focus

This isn’t just a site — it’s a tested product. I use this as a real QA sandbox to document:

- [ ] Functional testing flows

- [ ] Selenium test coverage

See the `qa-docs/` folder for all supporting files.
